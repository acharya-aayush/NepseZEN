# NEPSEZEN Project Completion Report


## Project Status: COMPLETE

The NEPSEZEN (Nepal Stock Exchange Simulator) project has been successfully completed. This report summarizes all completed components and provides guidance for usage. The project primarily focuses on NEPSE overview and simulation capabilities.

## Completed Components

1. **Core Infrastructure**
   - Config setup
   - Project structure
   - Documentation

2. **Data Layer**
   - Companies data loaded from JSON
   - Historical data generation with realistic market events
   - Data storage and retrieval system

3. **Analytics Engine**
   - Technical indicators implementation (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
   - Market analysis functions
   - Correlation analysis

4. **Visualization**
   - Interactive charts for price data
   - Performance visualizations
   - Sector-based analysis views

5. **Simulation**
   - Historical data simulation
   - Real-time market simulation
   - Event-based market dynamics

6. **Dashboard**
   - Streamlit-based interactive dashboard
   - Market overview
   - Company details view

7. **Documentation**
   - README.md
   - DOCUMENT.md (Technical documentation)
   - Developer notes
   - Product manager notes

## Data Generation

Historical data has been successfully generated for the following time periods:
- 1 month (30 days)
- 3 months (90 days)
- 6 months (180 days)
- 1 year (365 days)

## Running the Application

### Dashboard Mode
```
python main.py dashboard
```
This launches the Streamlit dashboard for interactive exploration of NEPSE data.

### Simulation Mode
```
python main.py simulation --days 30
```
This runs a historical simulation for the specified number of days.

### Real-time Simulation
```
python main.py realtime --minutes 60 --interval 5
```
This runs a real-time market simulation for 60 minutes with updates every 5 seconds.

## Testing

Basic testing infrastructure is in place, though some tests need updating to match the current implementation. The main functionality has been tested manually and works correctly.

## Known Issues

1. **Data Generation Issues**:
   - The data values in `main.py` are completely out of proportion in context to Nepal's market reality
   - Better data generator algorithm is needed for future versions
   - Consider implementing web scraping for real NEPSE data (idk if that's actually possible but worth a shot)
   - More accurate event simulation needed

2. **Code Structure Issues**:
   - Indentation problems in some files, particularly `main_builder.py`
   - Dashboard code could be more modular
   - Some test files need updating

## Future Enhancements

1. Complete test suite updates
2. Add portfolio management functionality
3. Implement news-based market event simulation
4. Create a backtesting module for trading strategies
5. Add user authentication for saving settings
6. Develop proper data generation algorithms that reflect actual NEPSE conditions
7. Create mobile-responsive UI
8. Implement web scraping for real market data

## Notes

The project has met all core requirements and is ready for user evaluation. The modular design allows for easy extension with additional features in the future. While the simulation features work correctly, future versions should focus on improving data accuracy to better reflect Nepal's actual market conditions.
